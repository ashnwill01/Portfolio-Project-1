## Introduction

Welcome to my first portfolio project! This portfolio is a comprehensive archive of my early projects in my journey of learning programming. The three projects on this page include the first responsive webpage I made, a CSS Cheat sheet for difficult to remember CSS code snippets, and a multi-page website for a fictional restaurant co-created by myself and my partner Rylan Powell. 

## Features

- Hover Animations: A hover effect over each project that darkens the image and shows the project title.
- Responsive Layout: This webpage is designed for easy viewing on any device, from your phone to your desktop computer.
- Interactive Features: From the buttons in the header that scroll you to the corresponding section of the page, to the project images that take you to the project website themselves.
